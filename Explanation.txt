Visual Explaination
1. Have created the POwerBI visualization for with slicer.
 one is the columar chart with tree map to find the title more rated.
2.Have creeated the Pie chart which represent the percentage wise the rating of the title.

Python Script
For the script we have parse the json and created the dataframe.
after that we have calculcated the size of the items and then order by asc
For the 2nd scenario we have shifted reverse and found the duplicate count in order to get the group pattern similiar.

We can as an alternative we can use pyspark also and createorReplaceview to write the above logic on sql also
